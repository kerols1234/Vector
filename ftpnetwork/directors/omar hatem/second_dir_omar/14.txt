The transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the physical medium) used to link devices to form a computer network include electrical cable, optical fiber, and radio waves. In the OSI model, these are defined at layers 1 and 2 â€” the physical layer and the data link layer.
A widely adopted family of transmission media used in local area network (LAN) technology is collectively known as Ethernet.
 The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by IEEE 802.3.
 Ethernet transmits data over both copper and fiber cables.
 Wireless LAN standards use radio waves, others use infrared signals as a transmission medium.
 Power line communication uses a building's power cabling to transmit data.
