The most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the telephone network.
 Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies.
 Address resolution and routing are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.

Another example of an overlay network is a distributed hash table, which maps keys to nodes in the network.
 In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a map) indexed by keys.
