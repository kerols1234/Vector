The physical layout of a network is usually less important than the topology that connects network nodes.
Most diagrams that describe a physical network are therefore topological, rather than geographic.
The symbols on these diagrams usually denote network links and network nodes.
Network topology is the layout or organizational hierarchy of interconnected nodes of a computer network.
Different network topologies can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical.
With many technologies, such as bus networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely.
In general the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.
